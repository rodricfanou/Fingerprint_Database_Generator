# Fingerprint_Database_Generator
Problem Statement
The MITMEngine project (https://github.com/cloudflare/mitmengine) detects HTTPS interception and user agent spoofing by checking if the TLS fingerprint of an incoming connection corresponds to the expected fingerprint for the connection’s user agent. MITMEngine powers the MALCOLM dashboard (https://malcolm.cloudflare.com). The goal of this project is to use BrowserStack to generate TLS client hello fingerprints and user agents for a selection of recent browsers and store them in a Postgres database.
